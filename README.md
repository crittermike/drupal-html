    Drupal Test HTML
--------------------------

INFORMATION:

In the index.html file, you'll find a bunch of HTML to be used to 
test your Drupal theme. It includes both regular old HTML elements
and Drupal-specific elements (such as tabs and status messages)

USAGE:

Just copy and paste everything in the index.html file into a node,
such as a page. The index.html purposely isn't a full HTML file 
(e.g., there is no <head>) so that the entire file can be copied
into the node and still validate.
